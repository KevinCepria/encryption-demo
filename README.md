## Encryption/Decryption Implementation

The API used for the encryption/decryption implementation is the **[Web Crypto API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API)**, which is native to JavaScript. Note that **CryptoJS** is no longer in active development. For more details, see the [CryptoJS Discontinued Notice](https://github.com/brix/crypto-js?tab=readme-ov-file#discontinued).
